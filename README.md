# Static Website with GitHub Pages

This project demonstrates how to host a simple, professional-looking static website using **GitHub Pages**. It includes an `index.html` file styled with `style.css`, deployed directly from a GitHub repository using GitHub Pages. This task simulates a real-world frontend deployment workflow, commonly seen in DevOps and portfolio hosting.

##  Tools Used

- **HTML** – Markup language for web structure  
- **CSS** – Styling the appearance of web content  
- **Git** – Version control system  
- **GitHub** – Code hosting platform  
- **GitHub Pages** – Static web hosting service built into GitHub    
## Objective

- Create a basic HTML website with clean and modern styling  
- Push the code to a GitHub repository  
- Host the site publicly using GitHub Pages  
- Verify the site is accessible over HTTPS with a valid GitHub Pages domain  
- Style the website to give a professional first impression  

##  Project Structure

 `index.html` - Main HTML page that renders the web content    
 `style.css`  - CSS file linked to `index.html` for styling    
 `README.md`   Documentation explaining the project and steps 

##  Key Workflow Summary

### 1️ Project Initialization

Created an `index.html` file with a simple greeting message and a linked `style.css` file for professional visual design.  
### 2️ Repository Creation & Push

A new GitHub repository was created. The HTML and CSS files were committed and pushed to the `main` branch.

### 3️ Enabling GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages was enabled under the repository's **Settings → Pages**. The source was set to `main` branch and root folder. GitHub generated a live deployment URL.

### 4️ Website Styling

Custom CSS was written in `style.css` to give the site a clean layout, readable fonts, and responsive spacing. It serves as a good example of how basic CSS can elevate presentation.

### 5 Website Deployment & Verification

The live website was successfully published at the default GitHub Pages domain. The site displays the updated content and styling after pushing changes.
